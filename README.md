# Cursor Auto-Mover
A simple tool that automatically moves your mouse cursor randomly on the screen.

## Quick Start
1. Double-click the `.exe` file to run
2. The cursor will start moving automatically:
    - Moves every second
    - Stays within safe screen boundaries
    - Shows movement feedback in console window

## Controls
- **ESC**: Press to stop the program cleanly
- **Ctrl+C**: Emergency stop (in console window)

## What to Expect
- A console window will open showing movement information
- Your cursor will move randomly every second
- Each movement is smooth and takes 0.5 seconds
- Movements stay within 1/4 of your screen size for safety

## Troubleshooting
If the program isn't working:
- Make sure you have administrator rights
- Check if your antivirus isn't blocking it
- If console closes immediately, run it from command prompt to see error messages

## Notes
- Keep the console window open while running
- Don't block cursor movement with other applications
- Program will continue running until ESC is pressed

That's all you need to know! Just run and press ESC when you want to stop.
